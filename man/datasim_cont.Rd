  n_arm,
  alloc_ratios,
  period_blocks = 2,
  mu0 = 0,

}
\arguments{
\item{n_total}{Overall sample size for the trial}

\item{num_arms}{Number of treatment arms in the trial}

\item{t_arm}{Timing of adding new arms in terms of number of patients allocated to the control arm}

\item{n_arm}{Sample size per arm}

\item{alloc_ratios}{Matrix with allocation ratios in each period}

\item{period_blocks}{Number to multiply the number of active arms with in order to get the block size per period}

\item{mu0}{Response in the control arm. Default=0}

\item{delta}{Vector with treatment effects for each arm}

\item{lambda}{Vector with strength of time trend in each arm}

\item{sigma}{Residual variance}

\item{trend}{Indicates the time trend pattern ("linear", "stepwise" or "inv_u")}

\item{N_peak}{Point at which the inverted-u time trend switches direction in terms of overall sample size}

\item{full}{Boolean. Indicates whether only variables needed for the analysis should be in the output (FALSE) or also additional information (lambdas, underlying responses) should be included (TRUE). Default=FALSE}
}
\value{
Data frame: simulated trial data

\description{
Simulates data from a platform trial with continuous endpoints and an arbitrary number of treatment arms entering sequentially. There is the option to either specify the timing of adding arms and the overall sample size in the trial or specify the sample size per arm (assumed equal) and the allocation ratios per period.
