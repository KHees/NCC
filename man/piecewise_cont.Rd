\title{Model-based analysis for continuous data using discontinuous piecewise polynomials per period}
\usage{
piecewise_cont(data, arm, alpha = 0.025, ncc = TRUE, poly_degree = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Simulated trial data, e.g. result from the \code{datasim_cont()} function}

\item{arm}{Indicator of the treatment arm under study to perform inference on (vector of length 1)}

\item{alpha}{Type I error. Default=0.025}

\item{ncc}{Boolean. Whether to include NCC data into the analysis. Default=TRUE}

\item{poly_degree}{Degree of the piecewise polynomial. Default=3}

\item{...}{Further arguments for simulation function}
}
\value{
List containing the p-value (one-sided), estimated treatment effect, 95\% confidence interval, an indicator whether the null hypothesis was rejected or not for the investigated treatment and the fitted model
}
\description{
Performs linear regression taking into account all trial data until the arm under study leaves the trial and adjusting for time using discontinuous piecewise polynomials in each period
}
\examples{

trial_data <- datasim_cont(num_arms = 3, n_arm = 100, d = c(0, 100, 250),
theta = rep(0.25, 3), lambda = rep(0.15, 4), sigma = 1, trend = "linear")

piecewise_cont(data = trial_data, arm = 3)
