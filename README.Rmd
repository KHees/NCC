## NCC

`NCC` allows users to simulate platform trials and to compare arms using non-concurrent control data. 

This package contains the following functions:

- `datasim_cont()` - simulates data with continuous outcomes
- `datasim_bin()` - simulates data with binary outcomes
- `get_ss_matrix()` - computes sample sizes per arm and period
- `linear_trend()` - generates linear trend for each patient
- `sw_trend()` - generates stepwise trend for each patient

### Design overview

We consider a platform trial evaluating the efficacy of $K$ treatment arms compared to a shared control. We assume that treatment arms enter the platform trial sequentially. In particular, we consider a trial starting with one initial treatment arm, where a new arm is added after every $\delta$ patients have been enrolled in the control arm.

We divide the duration of the trial into $S$ periods, where the periods are the time intervals bounded by any treatment arm either entering or leaving the platform.

The bellow figure illustrates the considered trial desing with $K$ treatment arms and $S$ periods.
