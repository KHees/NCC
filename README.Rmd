`NCC` package allows users to simulate platform trials and to compare arms using non-concurrent control data. 

This package contains the following functions:

- `datasim_cont()` simulates data with continuous outcomes
- `datasim_bin()` simulates data with binary outcomes
- `get_ss_matrix()` computes sample sizes per arm and period
- `linear_trend()` is the linear time trend function, used to generate the trend for each patient
- `sw_trend()` is the step-wise time trend function, used generate the trend for each patient

For a more detailed description of the functions, see the vignettes in the R-package website (https://pavlakrotka.github.io/NCC/).

### Design overview

We consider a platform trial evaluating the efficacy of $K$ treatment arms compared to a shared control. We assume that treatment arms enter the platform trial sequentially. In particular, we consider a trial starting with one initial treatment arm, where a new arm is added after every $d$ patients have been enrolled in the control arm.

We divide the duration of the trial into $S$ periods, where the periods are the time intervals bounded by times at which a treatment arm either enters or leaves the platform.

The below figure illustrates the considered trial design.
